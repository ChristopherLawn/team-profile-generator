## **Installation**
1. In order to run the application, download & install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your local device.  ***Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.***
2. After installing Node, clone the [Professional Team Profile Generator Repo](https://github.com/ChristopherLawn/team-profile-generator) to a project folder on your local device.
3. Open Bash and navigate to the root directory of the project folder.
4. Install all required dependencies for the project by entering the code:
    `npm install`.

## **Usage**
1. Once the dependencies are installed, run the app from the command line in Bash by entering the code:
    `node index.js`.  This will initiate a series of prompts.
2. Answer all 'Team Manager' prompts.  ***NOTE: All input is case-sensitive, so it is recommended that you double-check all of your work before submitting each answer.***
3. When prompted, select 'Yes' to add additional team members.
    * Select whether the new team member is an 'Engineer' or 'Intern'
    * Answer all prompts accordingly
3. When you're done building your team, find your newly created `team-profile.html` file - along with the `style.css` file to style it - in the 'dist' folder located inside the main project folder.
4. When creating multiple sites for different teams, make sure to copy and save the 'dist' folder to a separate destination before running the app again.  Each time the app is run, the `team-profile.html` file in the 'dist' folder will be replaced with the newest version.
